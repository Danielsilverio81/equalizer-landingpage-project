Landing page equalizer project, website template made for a Frontend Mentor challenge, challenges website for hands-on training of Frontend developers...

This challenge was very important for me, I had several difficulties but it was great, because I learned to get around and learn the solutions and to research, go after the documentation and at the end of my way I managed to copy the layout, I am open to constructive criticism and opinions on how to improve my code...
